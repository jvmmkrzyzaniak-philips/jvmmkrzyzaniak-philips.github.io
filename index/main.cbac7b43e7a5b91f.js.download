If you have Chinese ancestry, the First Ancestor view works best if you know your clan\'s first ancestor. If you don\'t know who he was, it may be easier for you to use the Landscape or another view in Family Tree. Users who have ancestors from other cultures are certainly welcome to experiment with the First Ancestor view. Realize that the First Ancestor view is not intended to be a general-purpose descendancy chart. The clan path is calculated using rules specific to the Chinese jiapu. This means it follows your father\'s paternal line to calculate a clan path and display the connection.
